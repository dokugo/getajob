## ðŸ˜± Just Get a Job Already

Gets the vacancies in my hometown from the local (`RU`) job search website via headless browser crawling made with [`Puppeteer`](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer). For example, try to search with the keywords such as `js` or `react`.


###### Please note that if you try to use [`https://getajob.now.sh`](https://getajob.now.sh), you might experience slow first-loading period since the free-tier Heroku instance "gets asleep" if it receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period and takes some time to get itself out of sleep, usually around 15 seconds.

### Run the dev version locally

``` shell
npm install
npm run server
npm run client
```

Don't forget to use [`puppeteer-heroku-buildpack`](https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git) in order to try Heroku deployment.
